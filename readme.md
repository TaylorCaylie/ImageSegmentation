This project implements the following image segmentation techniques:

- Generating a grey level histogram and threshold the image into
    - a binary image (black and white) with one threshold value
    - greyscale image with four segmented regions and three threshold values

- Pick 4 pixels from the image and uses the K-means clustering
method to segment the image into 3-6 regions

- Segments the image using edge and contour detection results
